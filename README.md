# About me

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on modelling in 3Ds Max and Rigging in Maya.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the prerequisites that fall under the 3D Animation category. Shout out to the professor that introduced me to this.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the Soda Punk Game.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with programming.
- 💬 Ask me about Blender, 3Ds Max, and Maya.
- I used Blender since I was in 7th Grade.
