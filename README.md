# About me

**CreeperCanine/CreeperCanine** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on modelling in 3Ds Max and Rigging in Maya.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Principles of Animation, and Level Design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the Soda Punk Game.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with programming.
- 💬 Ask me about Blender, 3Ds Max, and Maya.
- I used Blender since I was in 7th Grade.
